 Count Plot – Survival by Sex
Observation: The survival rate for females is significantly higher than for males.

Conclusion: Gender was a major factor in survival, likely due to the "women and children first" policy.

2. Count Plot – Survival by Passenger Class (Pclass)
Observation: First-class passengers had the highest survival rate, while third-class passengers had the lowest.

Conclusion: Class and accessibility to lifeboats played a key role.

3. Histogram – Age Distribution
Observation: A large number of passengers were young adults, with fewer children and elderly.

Conclusion: Children had a relatively higher chance of survival compared to adults.

4. Box Plot – Age by Pclass
Observation: First-class passengers were generally older than those in second or third class.

Conclusion: Wealthier passengers tended to be older, which may reflect family or travel purposes.

5. FacetGrid – Survival by Age and Sex
Observation: Young females had the highest survival rates; older males, especially in third class, had the lowest.

Conclusion: Age, gender, and class all interacted in determining survival.

6. Bar Plot – Embarked vs Survival
Observation: Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg had higher survival rates.

Conclusion: Many high-class passengers boarded from Cherbourg.

7. Heatmap – Correlation Matrix
Observation: Survival had moderate positive correlation with being female and higher class.

Conclusion: Certain features are more predictive of survival and useful for modeling.
